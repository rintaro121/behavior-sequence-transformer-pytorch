# Overview
The Behavior Sequence Transformer (BST) leverages the Transformer architecture to model user behavior sequences and predict the next item. This project focuses on predicting the next movie a user is likely to watch based on their interaction history.

# Dataset
The MovieLens dataset is used for training and evaluation. It contains user-movie interactions, including ratings and timestamps. The dataset is preprocessed to create sequential interaction data for next item prediction.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:rintaro121/behavior-sequence-transformer-pytorch.git
